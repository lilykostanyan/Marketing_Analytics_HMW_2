## Reproducibility and Seed Management

Reproducibility is critical in experiments like A/B testing because it allows you to re-run the experiments and get the same results. This is especially important for debugging, verification, and ensuring that the results are consistent over time. By combining **global seed management** with a **metadata file**, we can create robust, reproducible, and well-documented experiments.

### Why Reproducibility Matters

1. **Consistency**: Ensures that the same experiment produces identical results, even if it's run on a different machine or at a later time.
2. **Debugging**: Makes it easier to identify and fix issues because you can replicate exact conditions.
3. **Transparency**: Allows others to validate your work and build on it.
